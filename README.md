##Overview



## Theme / Setting / Genre
	- Casual Point Collection game
	- Apple Plantation setting

## Project Description 
Our group consists of two members Cason (in charge of GUI and Models) and Dhyatmika Suriyanto (in charge of game mechanics). This is a game we created for our final project in the Computer Graphics course at Binus International. 
We came up with the project idea based on paper toss as our inspiration but instead of paper toss we changed it into apple toss and called it The Furious Farmer. Our game is a web based game made with Babylon.js. The Goal of the game is to throw an apple into a basket and score the most points.
To make the game more challenging we added physics, life and wind. And the user can also adjust the power of each shot. We also added sound and a lot of models to make the game more pleasing to look at aesthetically 

## How to play the game
-	First clone or download the whole project
-	In the src folder you will find fruit_throw.html
-	Open fruit_throw.html with a browser (preferably Mozilla)
-	Enjoy the game

 
## Core Gameplay Mechanics Brief
- Physics: the game uses the CannonJS physics plugin to simulate the gravity and wind happening inside the game
- Power: in the game the player can control the power of each throw which controls the amount of force applied to the apple.
	- Life: in the game the player can miss no more than 5 shots.
	- Points: each successful throw to the basket counts as one point.
	- Controls: The main controls of the game are A,W,S,D,Space and R
			- a,w,s and d to control the arrow direction
			- Space to control power
			- R to reset the ball to the original position
## Targeted platforms
	- Web: This game is made to be a web based game played on browsers.

## Limitations
	-	If the apple falls off the arena the apple cannot be reset into place


##Project Scope 
	- The project took about one month to complete including the model preparation and mechanics.

## Story and Gameplay

### Story 

The story of the game is about a farmer who is harvesting his apples. Unfortunately, some of his apples turned out to be small. The farmer becomes enraged and decides to throw the apples into the basket instead of placing them into the basket slowly. After the first few throws the wind suddenly starts to become stronger making the throws more challenging. The furious farmer slowly starts to enjoy throwing the apple and decides to count how many he can get in. The more he misses the more furious he gets if the farmer misses more than 5 throws he will lose his patience and stop throwing apples.

### Gameplay 

The game starts in a field with an apple aimed at the basket. There is a board for score and wind on the left top corner and life and power at the right top corner. The player’s task is to aim and throw the apple to the basket. The player will get 5 lives and each time he throws and resets the apple there is a 60% chance that the wind will change. The range of wind is from -10 to +10 a negative value means that the wind blows to the left while a positive value means that it will blow to the right. The controls of the game are a,w,s and d for aiming the apple, space for controlling the power and r to reset the ball to the original position. If the apple reaches the goal it will automatically be placed back to the original position while if it misses the player should reset the ball at the cost of one life. When the life reaches 0 the player’s final score will be shown on screen and the game will reset.
